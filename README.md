I'm excited to share my latest projectâ€”a stunning real estate website built using ReactJS, modern CSS, Framer Motion, and the powerful Swiper.js library for a captivating image slider. In this project, I delved deep into React hooks, honed my CSS skills, and explored the world of animations to create a practical and visually engaging website for real estate listings.
